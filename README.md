## Project Overview

In todayâ€™s fast-moving fintech landscape, companies face intense competition for user acquisition and retention. Understanding how users interact with financial products and digital platforms is essential for building loyalty, increasing engagement, and driving sustainable growth. Modern fintech platforms must analyse behavioural trends and engagement patterns to:
 * Reduce customer acquisition costs
 * Improve user retention and lifetime value
 * Optimise product features and offerings
 * Personalise the user experience across channels
 * Mitigate risk through behavioral and financial profiling

This project leverages simulated fintech user data to:
 * Detect and predict churn behaviour
 * Drive adoption of financial products (e.g., credit cards, loans)
 * Tailor engagement strategies across mobile and web users
 * Analyse the impact of referrals, rewards, and app usage
 * Segment users for targeted outreach and product recommendations

Solution:
This project delivers an interactive analytics platform that analyses user behaviour, financial engagement, and product adoption trends. Through visualisations and machine learning models, it surfaces actionable insights for business strategy and operational decision-making.
